# BOGI
Intro to the battle of glorious ideas.

## What is the BOGI?

B.O.G.I. means _battle of glorious ideas_. The purpose of the _BOGI_ is to provide a minimal framework for ideation and idea selection.

## What are the use cases for the BOGI?

 - Collection and selection of innovation candidates
 - Discussion, screening and pre-qualification of product ideas
 - Assessment of customer or community generated ideas
 - Collection of ideas for your content strategy or marketing activity
 - Strengthening the teamwork and collaboration based on contribution
 - Preparation of a hackathon or comparable event
 - Regular practice of early business case evaluation
 - aso.

 The BOGI provides a lean set of tools and practices to collect, introduce, select and assess ideas.
 Ideas are important for a broad range of real life application, so that the BOGI is not reduced to one use case.

## What is the BOGI trying to solve?

In many environments and teams, the wisdom and creative potential of the group is not used systematically to generate ideas on a regular basis. But the openness towards new ideas and the increase of attention towards good ideas are key ingredients for continuous progress and adaption. That's why the BOGI shall solve some issues connected to the innovation and ideation progress by providing a slim toolset to start with. The focus is led on the group's internal capabilities which needs to be unleashed.

With the help of the BOGI, teams or companies shall be empowered to start working with and on ideas in a very practical way.
The BOGI provides a toolset, which furthermore can be hacked or adapted to the needs of a team / company. So there's no dogmatic view on the world behind the BOGI.

The BOGI covers the following aspects:

 1) Proposal of new ideas by individuals
 2) Collection of convincing ideas
 3) Qualification of candidates to follow-up upon
 4) Moving candidates through a mini-innovation funnel
 5) Selection of hot candidates for prototyping
 6) Hackathon - practical assessment of candidates
 7) Sandbox promo on prototypes
 8) Lean documentation of the outcome  

## What is the difference to other ideation / innovation practices?

The BOGI is trying to describe a minimalistic set of tools and simple routines for your lean ideation and innovation practice.
It is not solving organizational issues, not trying to be a holistic innovation theory.
The BOGI is a practical framwork with the focus on the selection of a few ideas out of many to follow up upon.

The approach behind the BOGI is discipline and expertise agnostic. 
It is not designed for any special group or kind of expertise. As such the BOGI is a tooling for every collaborative ambition and not reduced to engineers, product people or designers. 

Further more, the BOGI is not aiming for the behavioristical optimization of a message or product in the market.
It is not following an optimization thinking based on data only or based on numbers. The core approach is based on a qualitative discussion over time, which aims for the support of collaborative judgement. The BOGI supports aspects like presentation, discussion, selection, experimentation and judgement within the team. It is not agnostic to the people who are on a mission.

Other approaches to ideation and innovation pretend to follow some sort of universal truth, buulet-proof because of numbers, optimized based on the foundation of design, research and KPI monitoring. The BOGI is not trying to make such a bold statement. 
The BOGI is practical, can easily be fine-tuned or hacked, is a toolset for people and not against them.

## What are the benefits of the BOGI?

As any toolset, the BOGI does not deliver benefits through existence.
It can help to leverage potential and offers proposals of how start mining what is already there.

### Minimal risks

The BOGI is a pragmatic approach to collaborative idea selection and it supports innovation routines. 
It is easily possible to give it a try or cancel it if it does not work out.
The costs and efforts connected to the _battle of glorious ideas_ are low and easy to calculate.
You don't have to hire experts or consultants to just give it a try.
There is no need to invest into trainings, certificates and costly pre-requisites, before you start off.
That's why the BOGI is connected to minimal risks and barriers.

### Implicit benefits

The most important, implicit benefit is, that creative potential and team-wide experiences are brought into a lean approach for collaboration. With the BOGI your team is invited to contribute ideas, to intensify cross-departmental collaboration and think as collective. This invitation is a strong message and mandate as such. 

The BOGI can become a vital instrument or platform for the activation of the team's superpowers and it can help to focus the team(s) towards a _can do_ attitude. If done right, the BOGI intensifies individual abilities connected to presentation, argumentation, constructive discussion or creativity. In addition, the BOGI provokes regular discussions on general feasibility, relevance and value of ideas within the team(s). All of this creates a common understanding of what makes good ideas. This common sense can establish a healthy foundation for other  routines.

The BOGI can be a lot of fun. And there is nothing bad about it.
The presentation of your own hot idea in a BOGI session, the discussion within the tam and of course the tight realization of a cool idea with some team mates generates an environment in which contribution and skill-sharing are becoming the DNA of the new status quo. If that's connected to fun and the option for experimentation - even better. So the BOGI is a team sport for which all individual capabilites can make the difference.

If done properly, the BOGI can help to get the engine up and running.
Without taking the people out of the driver-seat. Instead, by letting them drive.

### Explicit benefits

The outcome of the BOGI typically is a long archive and a short list of ideas.

Ideas / candidates which made it through the BOGI-stages (= survivers) are typically relevant ideas for your scenario, e.g. product delighters, new business cases, ideas for campaigns, services or relevant improvements of the existing.
By attaching a crisp prototyping and review phase to the BOGI-flow, ideas could easily be pre-tested within a certain audience.
That allows the involvement of selected clients or stakeholders to the ideation journey and is way more precise than a theoretical draft in PowerPoint or Excel.

The explicit benefit of the BOGI is the sum of ideas generated. 

### ROI?

A real _return on invest_ calculation cannot be done to be honest, since it is up to you on how you implement a BOGI-routine and in which area you follow-up on your ideas or how compatible the BOGI toolset might be to you.

But in abstract terms, we could say something about it:
The time and material you invest can be planned and measured precisely. 
The explicit benefits (idea based outcome) can be measured on a quantitative and qualitative scale.
If some of those ideas will affect your business positively (under the assumption you tried it), then this outcome could be measured as a financial impact, of course.

In other words, invests and return on invests can be measured within each scenario.
But since the BOGI is a toolset, it cannot pretend its ROI only through existence.

## What is the BOGI  _NOT_?

 - The BOGI is no practice to optimize your product development routines, sales or marketing practices in certain details. But you can establish implicit benefits which also pay out in detail.
 - The BOGI is no framework to focus on Product-Market-Fit, to improve Customer or User Experience, to generate a Product Backlog or a Marketing plan.
 - The BOGI is no framework to control your costs over the entire Product Lifecycle or in Development.
 - It is not really an AGILE or a LEAN methodology, but there is absolutely no conflict with AGILE and a BOGI.
 - The BOGI is no guarantee for success. But it is a toolset to start working on ideas with a minimal invest and low barriers.
 - The BOGI is not Design Thinking and not Growth Hacking.
 - The BOGI is not limited to certain areas of use or technologies.
 
 The BOGI is NOT WRITTEN IN STONE - it is designed to be a minimal starting point and invitation to further adaption.
 It is understood correctly, if not interpreted as a dogmatic statement.

## BOGI requirements / pre-requisites / general recommendations

Practically, you don't have to buy anything or need to take special invests. 

Besides this, it is recommended to prepare the BOGI based on the following aspects:

- Any kind of innovation or ideation initiative works better if it is clearly backed up by a sponsorship of management or opinion leaders. The work on ideas will naturally require a certain amount of time, and it might be that even some materials have to be bought to do experiments or research. This budget should be named and approved to prevent negative surprises. Teams and individuals should feel invited and empowered to contribute to your BOGI.
- For all regular BOGI sessions a guideline or rule-of-thumb could be discussed in advance, which articulates when one is free to join or when higher-priority tasks should be done instead. E.g. you don't want to see your helpdesk empty, because all team members join a BOGI session. There are many ways to clarify prios and the setup for important availabilities in advance, so that it don't have to lead to conflicts for the daily operations.
- It is recommended to also think about a person willing to act as moderator and to maintain the sessions flow. It can be a person nominated or a role which is taken by one of the attendees of each session. But since it is a _battle_ (!) of ideas, it could make sense to have some moderator skills on board here - just in case the battle escalates ;).
- For practical realization tasks (e.g. content creation, prototyping or especially in the context of a hackathon) it should be clarified in advance, which skillsets would be required for contribution. It is a matter of logic, that the realization of some ideas might be connected to special skills. For example, if you have a technology driven offering and the ideas on the shortlist would be connected to highly technical tasks, then the barriers would be high. Not everyone would have the background to _implement_ a solution prototype here, for instance. But, if you plan it properly, you could add the ambition for making a first marketing-concept, to work on a value proposition or a sales strategy connected to the code-based candidate you work on. So, scope and fit to available skillsets should be discussed within the team(s), so that you can make the most out of your BOGI.
- It is recommended to discuss some criterias and mission objectives for your own BOGI. It is important to say something about the targets or the corridor you, as a sponsor or initiator of the BOGI, want to focus on at least. Like, what is the intention here (?), why are you going to introduce the BOGI (?). The BOGI can also work out in a decentralized way, in which the targets are broken down into smaller problem areas and decoupled groups or disciplines. But in any case it is valuable to articulate the underlying ambitions causing the introduction of a BOGI.
- A hard requirement connected to the BOGI would and has to be: BE OPEN FOR NEW IDEAS. Out of 100 ideas, perhaps you will see only 5 brilliant ideas, perhaps only 1 realized as prototype. But you need to take 100 ideas to identify the one great idea you waited for. So be patient, be extremely open for thoughts which might not reflect your present opinion, be open for experimentation and failure. Good ideas grow best in environments where many ideas can be discussed and where failure is expected to happen. Therefore, it is highly recommended, that a broad range of thoughts is allowed and respected, before you ask people to share their thoughts on a regular basis. If you are not open for good and bad ideas, then you should not seriously think about ideation en scale.
- Use the BOGI not only as a platform for interdisciplinary collaboration - use it to break up hierachy thinking, too. The discussion of ideas is most powerful, if arguments count, not boss levels. In addition to that, for any organization it can become a very healthy best practice, if top managers join the discussion and ideation like any other employee and under the same conditions. Therefore, the BOGI can become a vital platform for exchange of thoughts between teams, disciplines and hierarchy levels.

You can imagine more requirements perhaps, depending on your scenario. The BOGI itself is not coming along which much barriers or requirements.
