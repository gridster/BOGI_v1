## What is the BOGI trying to solve?

In many environments and teams, the wisdom and creative potential of the group is not used systematically to generate ideas on a regular basis. But the openness towards new ideas and the increase of attention towards good ideas are key ingredients for continuous progress and adaption. That's why the _BOGI_ shall solve some issues connected to the innovation and ideation progress by providing a slim toolset to start with. The focus is led on the group's internal capabilities which needs to be unleashed.

With the help of the _BOGI_, teams or companies shall be empowered to start working with and on ideas in a very practical way.
The _BOGI_ provides a toolset, which furthermore can be hacked or adapted to the needs of a team / company. So there's no dogmatic view on the world behind the _BOGI_.

The _Battle Of Glorious Ideas_ covers the following core aspects:

 1) Proposal of new ideas by individuals
 2) Collection of convincing ideas
 3) Qualification of candidates to follow-up upon
 4) Moving candidates through a mini-innovation funnel
 5) Selection of hot candidates for prototyping
 6) Hackathon - practical assessment of candidates
 7) Sandbox promo on prototypes
 8) Lean documentation of the outcome
